        <p>No software product is free of bugs and can therefore always be improved. This is especially true for the
        currently prototypical implementation of
        the <a href="http://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings195/95.pdf">Open eCard App</a>.</p>
        <p>Against this background, the Open eCard Team is gladly receiving bug reports and proposals and is working
        hard to address them in time and to provide feedback for the input.</p>
        <p>The Open eCard Project is providing an issue tracker
        at <a href="http://openecard.org/issues">http://openecard.org/issues</a> in order to receive and manage the bug
        reports and proposals.</p>
